I found this homework very challenging and had to backtrack and redo parts of it. The setting of the primary and foreign keys was very confusing. Thankfully I was apart of an excellent study group lead by classmate-Brandon Britt and Brian Miller and Samanatha Cook were there as well. After making all of the tables in QuickDBD and setting the keys, I exported*(left export message from QuickDBD at top of code) the information to pgAdmin 4. I did this because I felt I knew how to do it and if I created it, it would look extremely similar. Next I entered all the tables data into the schema. Finally with the help of my classmates, we worked through all 8 problems for the Data Analysis.
